# nZombiesAfterlife
The "Afterlife" feature, from "Mob of the Dead", implemented in the Garry's Mod gamemode "nZombies".

The version of this project that's currently on the Steam Workshop (here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1568432192) as of when i'm writing this is very messy and somewhat broken. I want to push an update to fix that, but given my situation with classes and finding work, i'm probably not gonna be able to do this alone in a reasonable time period. That's where this comes in. With this repository, progress can be tracked and changes can be suggested.
